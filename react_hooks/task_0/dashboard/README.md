### Task 0. Convert Header Component

From now on, you'll be using modern React with functional components and hooks, instead of ES6 classes and React lifecycle methods.

Re-use the codebase from the `react_state` project for the previous task and let's begin modernizing the React code.

**Instructions:**

- Transform the Header.jsx class component into a functional component
- Implement context consumption using the appropriate hook (useContext)
- Ensure all existing functionalities are preserved

**Requirements:**

- You must use the appropriate hook for context consumption
- The exact same JSX structure should be maintained
- Handle the context values properly with no errors or warnings
- Once the user is logged in, a welcome message and a logout link should be displayed
- The logout link must work as expected
- Ensure that there are no console errors or warnings
- The code should have no lint errors
