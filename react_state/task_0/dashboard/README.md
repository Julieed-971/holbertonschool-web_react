### Task 0. Adding a local state for notifications

Using the previous project (React inline styling), we have modularized our React application without worrying about interactions and state, which is usually a recommended approach to development. Now, our application is in a good position to start adding logic and state.

**Modify the App component in `task_0/dashboard/src/App/App.jsx`:**

Create a local state to store a `displayDrawer` element:

- Define the default value for the state in the constructor of the Class
- Create a function named `handleDisplayDrawer` that will set the value of `displayDrawer` to `true`
- Create a function named `handleHideDrawer` that will set the value of `displayDrawer` to `false`

**Modify the Notifications import in `App.jsx`:**

- Pass the `displayDrawer` prop to the component using the local state
- Pass the new functions `handleDisplayDrawer` and `handleHideDrawer` as props

**Modify the Notifications component in `Notifications.jsx`:**

- When clicking on "Your notifications", call `handleDisplayDrawer`
- When clicking on the close button, call `handleHideDrawer`

At this point, after reloading the React application you should be able to show or hide the notifications panel

**Modify the Notifications test suite in `Notifications.spec.js`:**

- Add a test to verify that clicking on the menu item calls `handleDisplayDrawer`
- Add a test to verify that clicking on the close button calls `handleHideDrawer`

**Tips:**

- Remember that you implemented `shouldComponentUpdate`. You will need to modify its logic to allow the component to re-render when the `displayDrawer` prop changes
- Remember to use spies to verify whether a function is being called. You can pass a spy as a property

**Requirements:**

- When running the application, there should not be any errors in the console
