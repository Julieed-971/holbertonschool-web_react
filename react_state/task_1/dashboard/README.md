### Task 1. Controlled components and state callback

Create a form within the Login component & handle login submission in `task_1/dashboard/src/Login/Login.jsx`:

To solve this task, you should convert the functional Login component to a class component:

- Create a local state with the value `isLoggedIn` set to `false`
- Create a function named `handleLoginSubmit` that updates the local state by setting `isLoggedIn` to `true`
- Wrap the input fields within a `form` element
- Replace the button with an `input` element of type `submit`
- When the form is submitted, call the newly created login submission handling function

**Create controlled component:**

- Modify the local state to add two new values: `email` and `password`. By default, both should be empty strings
- Set the `email` and the `password` input values to the local state
- Create two methods, `handleChangeEmail` and `handleChangePassword`:
  - Each method should handle changes to its respective input field (Email or Password):
    - When the user types into the email input, `handleChangeEmail` should be called
    - When the user types into the password input, `handleChangePassword` should be called
  - Ensure the local component state updates in real time as the user types:
    - The email input field should update the `email` state
    - The password input field should update the `password` state accordingly

**Modify state callback:**

- Modify the local state to add a new value `enableSubmit`, set to `false` by default
- Modify the Submit button so that it is only enabled when the `enableSubmit` value is `true`
- Enable the Submit button whenever:
  - Both fields are not empty
  - The email input contains a valid email address
  - The password input contains at least 8 characters

**Add tests:**

- Add a test to verify that the submit button is disabled by default
- Add a test to verify that the button becomes enabled only after both the Email and Password inputs meet the required criteria

**Requirements:**

- The state should have all the default values set in the constructor
- Submitting the form should not reload the page
- The email input must be valid email address, and the password must have at least 8 characters
- The submit input should be enabled when the above conditions are met
- There should not be any linting errors in the console when running the application

**Tips:**

- Use a regular expression (Regex) to validate the email input
- At this stage, clicking the enabled Submit input does not render the CourseList component. This functionality will be addressed in the next task
