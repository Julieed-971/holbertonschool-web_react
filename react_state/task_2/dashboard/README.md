### Task 2. Context

**Create a simple React Context in `task_2/dashboard/src/Context/context.js`:**

- Define a default user object with the following properties:
  - `email`: set to an empty string
  - `password`: set to an empty string
  - `isLoggedIn`: set to `false`
- Define a default `logOut` function as an empty function
- Create and export (with `export default` only) a `newContext` variable that initializes a new React context. This context should include the `user` object and the `logOut` function as its default values

**Create the local state for the App in `App.jsx`:**

- Update the local state of the App component by:
  - Adding a `user` object that mirrors the context's user object
  - Adding a `logout` property that references the `logOut` function from the context
- Create a `logIn` method that takes `email` and `password` as parameters. When the method is called:
  - Update the `user` object in the local state
  - Set the `email` and `password` to the values entered
  - Set the `isLoggedIn` value to `true`
- Create a `logOut` method that resets the value of the `user` object in the local state
- Remove the `isLoggedIn` and `logOut` props from the App. These will now be accessed through the state
- In the `render()` method, refactor the code to use the state to display either the `CourseList` or the `Login` components
- Pass the new `logIn` method, along with the user's email and password, to the `Login` component as props

**In `Login.jsx`:**

- Update the local state:
  - Remove the `isLoggedIn` property, as it is no longer used
  - Retrieve `email` and `password` from the props object (ensure they have default values)
- Modify the `handleLoginSubmit` to call the newly created `logIn` method from the props

**Checkpoint:**

Test your application. At this point, you should be able to log in to your React app:

- By entering a valid email and a password with 8 or more characters:
  - The submit button should become clickable
  - The CourseList component should render
  - The Login component should unmount
- Verify that the Notifications panel continues to work correctly. You should be able to show/hide the panel by clicking the top-right text and the close button

**Setting the context in `App.jsx`:**

- In the App component, wrap the entire app with the context provider element created earlier
- Set the value of the provider to the context's `user` object and `logOut` function using the local state

**Add tests on the `Login.spec.js`:**

- Verify that the `logIn` method prop is correctly called with the user's email and password when the login form is submitted

**Tip:**

- As we're carrying forward tests from task1, note that the App component's architecture changed in task2. It no longer accepts `isLoggedIn` as a prop - it uses Context-based state instead. You may need to adjust related tests accordingly

**Requirements:**

- Be aware that React Context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render. Avoid directly creating objects within the provider's value prop
- The submit button should only be enabled if the email is valid and the password is at least 8 characters long
