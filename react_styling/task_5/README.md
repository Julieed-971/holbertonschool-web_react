### Task 5. Animation

In this task you'll apply a `tailwind bounce animation` to the notifications title `Your notifications`

The condition is simple, in the `Notifications.jsx`:

- Whenever the `notifications` prop array length is > 0 AND the `displayDrawer` prop is set to `false` then add the bounce animation
- Otherwise no bounce animation applied
- Consider how to conditionally apply CSS classes in React based on prop values

**Requirements:**

- Your final UI should be the same as shown in the screenshots
- Don't remove any existing classes or ids
- You're not allowed to create any TailwindCSS configuration file
- No CSS file import statement in all components
- No `*.css` files allowed (except for the `main.css` that's already provided)
